I'm based in Campbelltown so it's a bit of a trek for me, but I've got the skills and gear to do a quality job. Just want to check - is the $600 budget flexible at all? For prep, materials, and a proper exterior finish on timber, it'd likely come in a bit higher. Happy to chat through options if you're open to it. Cheers, Paul - 0488592524",
